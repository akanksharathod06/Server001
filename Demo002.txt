Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for pushing you code:

1. Set Up Git Locally
First, ensure you have Git installed on your local machine.

2. Create a New Repository on GitHub

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Click on the + icon in the upper-right corner and select "New repository."
Fill in the repository name, description (optional), and choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
Click on the "Create repository" button.
3. Initialize a Local Repository

If you don't have a local repository set up yet:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize your repository using the cd command.
Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
git init
4. Add Your Files
Add the files you want to commit to your repository.
Use the git add command to add files to the staging area. You can add individual files or all files:

git add filename
or
git add .

5. Commit Your Changes
Commit the files to the repository with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"

6. Add the Remote Repository
Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you created. Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPOSITORY_NAME with the name of your GitHub repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

7. Push Your Code
Push your changes to GitHub. The first push might require you to set the upstream branch:
git push -u origin master
